Description: Event-based framework for internet applications
 It includes a web server, a telnet server, a multiplayer RPG engine, a
 generic client and server for remote object access, and APIs for creating
 new protocols.
 .
 Additionally it includes protocol-specific implementations such as:
 .
 Twisted Conch: a client/server implementation of the SSH protocol,
 using the twisted framework.
 .
 Twisted Mail: contains high-level, efficient protocol implementations
 for both clients and servers of SMTP, POP3, and IMAP4. Additionally,
 it contains an "out of the box" combination SMTP/POP3 virtual-hosting
 mail server. Also included is a read/write Maildir implementation and
 a basic Mail Exchange calculator (depends on Twisted Names).
 .
 Twisted Web: a web server, and also provides basic HTTP client
 support. You may want to check out Nevow, a templating toolkit
 designed for twisted.web, and Twisted Web2, the next generation
 Twisted web server.
 .
 Twisted Words includes:
  - Low-level protocol implementations of OSCAR (AIM and ICQ), IRC, MSN,
    TOC (AIM).
  - Jabber libraries.
  - Prototypes of chat server and client frameworks built on top
    of the protocols.
